## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Node.js

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/vincentchan1224/HTTP5222.git
   cd final_project_2
   ```

2. **Rename `.env_` file**

   Rename the `.env_` file to `.env` to include your environment variables:

   ```bash
   mv .env_ .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the necessary modules from `node_modules`:

   ```bash
